<h1>Installing Windows Server 2016 OS (Domain Controller)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is the initial step of this project. I will first create a virtual machine on the software called Oracle VirtualBox and then rename the VM as "Windows Server 2016". I will then install the Windows Server 2016 operating system inside of the VM.</p>

<p align="center">This is the first step in this project. I’ve installed the software called “ORACLE VIRTUALBOX” and this software will allow me to install and manage virtual devices on my laptop. Using this software will allow me to create a small network in which I will create a domain and that domain will include a server and some clients. I will also be able to use “Active Directory” to manage users and computers.</p>

<p align="center">The next step is to click where it says “NEW”. This function will allow me to add a virtual client inside the software “VirtualBox”. In this case, I will try to add “Windows Server 2016” which will be used for active directory, to create a domain and manage all clients on the domain.</p>

<p align="center">The next step is to add informations about the virtual machine that I want to add and configure it with the appropriate needs. As you can see, I’ve filled all of the informations required for this virtual machine. I’ve included the name with “Windows Server 2016” and selected the version as “Windows 2016 (64-bit)”. After this is done, I proceeded by click on the button “Next”. As you can see, I haven’t selected an ISO image to run the Operating System of Windows, I will add it once I run the actual Virtual Machine.</p>
